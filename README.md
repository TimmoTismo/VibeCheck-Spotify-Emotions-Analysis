# VibeCheck-Spotify-Emotions-Analysis

## About
VibeCheck is an emotions analysis web application that extracts insights from the user's listening habits on Spotify and uses machine learning to classify their mood. It also provides clean and informative graphs for the user to analyse and interpret. \
\
This project aims to explore the application of machine learning techniques in predicting the emotions conveyed from music. Emotion analysis is a complex task, both for humans and machines, as emotions can be subjective and multifaceted. By focusing on music, which is known to evoke various emotions in listeners, we aim to develop a model that accurately predicts the emotions conveyed in a song. \
\
VibeCheck retrieves hidden values from Spotify called 'Audio Features' which gives measurements such as tempo, key, energy, loudness and many more. These measurements are used ato train a machine learning model which is able to predict and classify what emotion best fits each song. The machine learning model is incorporated into VibeCheck and allows users to see what emotions are conveyed from their most recently played songs.\
